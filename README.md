- Create complete flows that are browsable and clickable
- Code the UI by using Tailwind v3+. You can use open source UI kits
- If you get hired and stay at HealthOS for at least 60 days you will get a
  salary bonus of 5 000 BDT for completing this test

## Requirements & Criterias

At registration a user logs in with a unique Bangladeshi phone no and password,
the same credentials are used to get a JWT and then login to the app The data
will be primarily stored by fetching data from the backend but we are not
focusing on the API calls right now. You can hardcode the data into the code as
JSON if you want to skip that part totally or you can serve the JSON via Github
pages and do axios/fetch calls

## What we will grade

- Your understanding of ReactJS and its basic concepts (components, hooks, data
  fetching and stores, HOCs, layouts etc)
- Your understanding of UI/UX principles
- Your ability to write readable and concise code
- Your ability to properly structure a ReactJS project with distinct components
  that makes sense in the context of a project like this
- Your understanding of basic principles and concepts in ReactJS / Javascript
- Your ability to structure logic in coherently in a ReactJS project
- Your ability to implement and understand best practices where applicable
- Your ability to convey intention via Your code and comments
- Your ability to compose clear and concise Github commits
- Your understanding of ReactJS ecosystem and popular tools and libraries
- The quality of your assumptions and the choices you make
- The amount of time You spent to solve this problem

## Bonus points (NOT mandatory)

- Store Your JSON lists in a remote repository like S3 or in a backend server of
  your choice and fetch the data with Axios or similar libraries
- Complete all 6 views and add a login view and a registration view consisting
  of basic forms for login and registration

## Guidelines

- You do not need to write any backend code for this test
- The purpose of this test is not to write a fully functional web application
  but rather to see how You reason through the requirements to write the
  skeleton / minimal viable code that looks good and has great UX / UI
- We believe that someone who has 1 year of experience with ReactJS on a daily
  basis could finish this task within 5-6 hours on average if they properly use
  the open source resources that are available on the web
- You do not need to copy the UI from the mockups and be pixel perfect. The
  important thing is that we understand that You can build the project with a
  good understanding of UX/UI. What You are allowed to do
- Use any third-party open source libraries of Your choice, state it clearly in
  package.json and the README.md if you have used anything that is not open
  source
- Use open source UI kits freely available on the web
- Re-use code that You have written Yourself in other projects

## What You cannot do

- Ask questions as we are not in a classroom setting and this test will
  eventually be done by people in different time zones. People who get to ask
  questions will get an unfair advantage and it would skew the grading and
  results.

## Submission and final grading

- Push the project to a public Github repository when done
- Push the project to a live URL on Vercel / Netlify
- The timestamps and the commits will play a role in the grading
- Writing understandable commit messages is a big part of the task
- The less time You spend and the more well composed/granular commit messages
  there are, the more points You will get
- You can write a few messages in the code as comments to explain Your choices
  and reasoning if You feel that it would make things easier for the person who
  is grading Your code.
- Submit your work example by sharing the link to Your Github public repo in
  this Google Form (https://forms.gle/f2GZ253LSWRF6iob6), along with the email
  address You used in your application and when doing our earlier Quiz.

Good luck! The HealthOS Development Team
